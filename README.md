Welcome to the Simon Says Color Memory Game repository! ðŸŽ®ðŸŒˆ  This game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors shown by the game. The sequence grows longer with each correct repetition, testing the playerâ€™s memory and concentration. Can you keep up as the game gets harder?

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the game layout and buttons.
CSS: For styling the game interface and adding animations.
JavaScript: For managing the game logic, including generating the sequence, handling user input, and checking for correctness.

How to Play:
~The game will display a color sequence.
~The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the exact order.
